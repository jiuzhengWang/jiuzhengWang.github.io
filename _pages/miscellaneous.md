Like most Chinese students, I can speak both Chinese and English. I am also interested in learning Japanese.

I am a sporting man, enjoying basketball as well as swimming. Running is also in my daily routine. Wish you could join me when doing sports!

I've met a lot of good friends in my CS career: [Huanran Chen](https://huanranchen.github.io/)(陈焕然), [Jiaqi Liao](https://skqliiiao.github.io/)(廖嘉琦), [Yuchen Song](https://sycstudio.com/)(宋聿辰), [Chengbo Yuan](https://github.com/michael-qwq)(袁承博), [Shuyu Zhou](https://github.com/zusuyu)(周书予), Yanbo Yin(殷彦博), [Chen Lin](https://github.com/BITcyman)(林晨), [Shuhao Zhang](https://github.com/StudyingFather)(张书豪), Ziyi Gao(高子翼), Zihao Liao(廖子豪), Tian Tang(唐添) and Sijin Peng(彭思进) are all outstanding people in their areas.
