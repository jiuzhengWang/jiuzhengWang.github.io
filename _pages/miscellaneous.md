Like most Chinese students, I can speak both Chinese and English. I am also interested in learning Japanese.

I am a sporting man, enjoying basketball as well as swimming. Running is also in my daily routine. Wish you could join me when doing sports!

I've met a lot of good friends: [Huanran Chen](https://huanranchen.github.io/)(computer vision), [Jiaqi Liao](https://skqliiiao.github.io/)(optics and photonics), [Yuchen Song](https://sycstudio.com/)(computer networks) are all outstanding people in their areas.
