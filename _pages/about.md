Hi! My name is 王九铮. I am a forthcoming Ph.D candidate in [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University, under the supervision of [Yun Ma](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1hnJ3TgAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Xiaoying Bai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PzOx2UUAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). I am currently a research intern in [PACMAN](https://pacman.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/), advised by [Jidong Zhai](https://pacman.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~zjd/). Before that, I was a senior undergraduate in [School of Computer Science & Technology](https://cs.bit.edu.cn/), Beijing Institute of Technology.

My research interests lie in a broad topics of **computer systems and software**. Currently I am interested in compilation and parallel optimization for AI applications.

I have another personal website just for [blog](https://cerf-volantwang.github.io/). Go and have a look!

If you are interested in me and my research, feel free to contact me! Email: [jiuzheng2021@gmail.com](jiuzheng2021@gmail.com).
