Hi! My name is 王九铮. I'm a junior undergraduate in [School of Computer Science & Technology](https://cs.bit.edu.cn/) at Beijing Institute of Technology. I am applying for Ph.D programs for 2024 Fall.


My research interests lies in a broad topics of **computer system and software**. I am currently interested in *blockchain technology*.

I am fortunate to be advised by Prof.[Hao Yin](https://www.bnrist.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1152/2519.htm) in Tsinghua University. Before that, I have been working with Prof.[Shaofeng Jiang](https://shaofengjiang.cn/) on *streaming and sublinear-time* algorithms. Earlier in my undergraduate studies, I have been working on *algorithmic game theory* and *machine learning theory* under the guidance of Prof.[Zhengyang Liu](https://lozycs.github.io/) and Prof.[Zhida Qin](https://cs.bit.edu.cn/szdw/jsml/fjs/qzd/index.htm), respectively.

I was professional in Mathematical Olympiad, and I devoted myself to *theoretical computer science*. Though I've switched my research fields to *computer systems and softwares*, I am still interested in any theoretical problems, and I truly believe my research experience on TCS benefits me a lot. 

If you are interested in me, feel free to contact me! Email: [jiuzheng2021@gmail.com](jiuzheng2021@gmail.com)
