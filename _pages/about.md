Hi! My name is 王九铮. I'm a senior undergraduate in [School of Computer Science & Technology](https://cs.bit.edu.cn/), Beijing Institute of Technology. I am a forthcoming Ph.D candidate in [School of Computer Science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), Peking University, under the supervision of [Xiaoying Bai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PzOx2UUAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [Yun Ma](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1hnJ3TgAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). My research interests lie in a broad topics of **computer systems and software**. I am currently interested in *blockchain technology*.

I am fortunate to be advised by Prof.[Hao Yin](https://www.bnrist.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1152/2519.htm) in Tsinghua University. Before that, I have been working with Prof.[Shaofeng H.-C. Jiang](https://shaofengjiang.cn/) on *streaming and sublinear-time* algorithms. Earlier in my undergraduate studies, I have been working on *algorithmic game theory* and *machine learning theory* under the guidance of Prof.[Zhengyang Liu](https://lozycs.github.io/) and Prof.[Zhida Qin](https://cs.bit.edu.cn/szdw/jsml/fjs/qzd/index.htm), respectively.

I was professional in Mathematical Olympiad, and I am still interested in any theoretical problems. I am currently interested in a problem named junta testing.

If you are interested in me and my research, feel free to contact me! Email: [jiuzheng2021@gmail.com](jiuzheng2021@gmail.com).
