Hi! My name is 王九铮. I am an third grade undergraduate in [School of Computer Science & Technology](https://cs.bit.edu.cn/) at Beijing Institute of Technology. I am applying for Ph.D programs for 2024 Fall.


My research interests lies in a broad topics of **theoretical computer science**. I am currently interested in *sublinear algorithms*.

I am fortunate to be advised by Prof.[Zhengyang Liu](https://lozycs.github.io/) at BIT. Before that, I worked on some topics about **recommendation system** under the guidance of Prof.[Zhida Qin](https://cs.bit.edu.cn/szdw/jsml/fjs/qzd/index.htm) in 2021. I am also advised by Prof.[Changsheng Li](https://cs.bit.edu.cn/szdw/jsml/gjjgccrc/lcs_e253eb02bdf246c4a88e1d2499212546/index.htm) since Fall 2022.
